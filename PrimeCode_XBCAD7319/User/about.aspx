      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">We Feed SA Story</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">weFEEDsa is the magical result where like-minded people come together to serve humanity.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The journey begins:</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Our journey began during a dark time in history, the 2020 Covid Lockdown. Volunteers, men, women, and children disturbed by the plight of the homeless during Lockdown came together to feed those in need. At the peak of support, we provided 12,000 daily meals, 7 days a week, across 35 sites in KZN.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How they Grow:</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">From there weFEEDsa has grown and evolved. We still continue to feed by supporting 7 soup kitchens and providing hampers to families in need as feeding is a basic human need but we also have evolved to improve sustainability by implementing 34 boreholes and vegetable gardens. After the KZN Floods in April 2022, we repaired 10 schools, 50 homes, and established 30 boreholes with potable water to address the water crisis.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Education the key to change:</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">We believe that education is the key to empowering society and as a result, we provide bursaries and training programs to those who wish to be uplifted. We work closely with a Seta accredited training academy to provide not just upskilling but certification and work experience which directly addresses the high unemployment which exists in our country.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How they work:</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Our methodology is collaboration. There is so much to do that we need to work together to make this shift happen. We work with about 100 NGOs, community-based organisations, and companies. The key to change is to involve not only individuals but businesses who drive the change of the country and organizations to see what effect we can affect quickly and effectively.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">As Mahatma Gandhi said, we need to be the change we wish to see and that's what weFEEDsa try to do. To provide hope that things can be improved, that as humanity we can and will be the change we wish to see in the world.</p>
      <p class="font-bold">Do Good. Feel Good. Get Good.</p>
